description: When Patty Went to College is a humorous novel about life in an all-girls'
  college at the turn of the century. Patty is a happy, fun-loving prankster who defends
  the weak and uses her clever brain only when it suits her. The end of the novel
  sees her contemplating life outside of college, and wondering whether her misbehavior
  will stand her in good stead for it.
